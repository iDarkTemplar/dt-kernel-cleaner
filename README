dt-kernel-cleaner is a tool for removing installed files and sources of kernel no longer needed

It cleans files in /boot, /lib/modules and /usr/src for selected kernel versions.
Tool recognizes kernel version and kernel source version. If selected version matches no kernel version, but matches kernel source version,
then it'll also clean kernels which match kernel source version but have different revision suffix, i.e. kernels built from selected kernel sources.
Unless option "--keep-sources" is set, when all kernels built from specific kernel source version are cleaned, kernel source is removed too.

USAGE: dt-kernel-cleaner [options] kernel_version
Options:
	[-h] --help - shows this info
	[-l] --list-only - list found kernel versions and exit. Do not specify kernel versions with this option
	[-v] --verbose - list found files and also print actions before executing them
	[-n] --dryrun - do not execute actions, only print them
	[-k] --keep-vmlinuzold - do not remove vmlinuz.old symlink if it becomes obsolete
